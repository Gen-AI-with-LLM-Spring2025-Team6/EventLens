CONCORD MA,978,"The Umbrella Arts Center in historic Concord Center will commemorate the semiquincentennial of the American Revolution and “the shot heard round the world” with an ambitious outdoor/indoor public and gallery art exhibition, Weaving an Address, curated by artist Marla McLeod. For the first time, Weaving an Address combines The Umbrella’s popular Art Ramble public art installation, on view April 15 through October 7 at Brister’s Hill in nearby Walden Woods, with an indoor exhibition on view April 14 through June 14 in The Umbrella’s Allie Kussin Gallery. The exhibition features site-specific work by eight prominent Black artists combining sculpture, fiber art, installation and live performance inspired by little-known experiences of historical Black inhabitants of Concord and its Walden Woods. Featured artists in the exhibition are Ifé Franklin, Stephen Hamilton, Whitney Harris, Ekua Holmes, Perla Mabel, Marla McLeod, Kimberly Love Radcliffe, and Anthony Peyton Young. Outdoors, large-scale work will be installed on Brister’s Hill, named for Brister Freeman, an enslaved man who won his freedom by serving in the Revolutionary War and then bought the property and lived there along with other formerly enslaved. Indoors at The Umbrella, inter-related fiber artworks will weave narratives from fragmented pasts to offer a vision of how history shapes the present and influences the future. Supporting community activities include an opening reception on April 14, monthly curator talks, a processional with artist Ifé Franklin, and participation in the town-wide Revolutionary Concordians Trading Card program. This exhibition is presented as part of the Concord250 commemoration, in partnership with The Walden Woods Project and The Robbins House, in association with Gather 2025, a month-long exploration and celebration of fiber and textile art in Greater Boston, and with permission of Concord Natural Resources Division. See https://TheUmbrellaArts.org/Weaving for more information about special engagements, wayfinding, artist bios, and background to the exhibition. ACCESS: The Umbrella is wheelchair accessible, with ADA parking and marked all-gender bathrooms available. There is assessed parking for visitors to the Brister's Hill site on Walden Street, just north of the intersection with Route 2. More details on our website.",Free

Our goal has always been to be firmly rooted in our community with everything we do. Whether it’s collaborating with other local businesses in our area (FRANK / Crave / Wandering Soul/ Fat Tuna Charters/ Half Baked) or giving back to the place that has given us so much (Beverly Hospital/HarborLight community partners) . This idea of community rings true in our taproom as well. Our space has become a meeting place to hear local musicians, enjoy local artists, and get a taste of various foods in the Beverly area . It’s also a space where we would like ALL members of our community to feel welcome and accepted. For many, craft breweries can sometimes feel exclusive and intimidating for those that don’t consider themselves “beer nerds” and this is a notion we will always work hard to dispel. We believe beer should be fun/accepting and our goal is to always have a variety of beers that speak to a wide audience.

Join us at Old South Meeting House on Thursday, April 17, for this 60-minute historical drama that depicts Holmes looking back at his life on the battlefield and the bench on his 90th birthday in 1931. Following the film, engage in a compelling conversation with our evening’s panelists—retired Supreme Judicial Court Associate Justice Robert Cordy, Boston lawyer RJ Lyman, and the film’s screenwriter, Todd Peppers.

To kick off Boston’s Patriots’ Day weekend celebrations in partnership with the City of Boston, Old North Illuminated will stage a free reading of the hit play Revolution’s Edge behind Old North Church on Paul Revere Mall. Mayor Michelle Wu and other local officials will attend the play and give remarks to commemorate this historic anniversary. Written by Patrick Gabridge and produced by Plays in Place, Revolution’s Edge is a gripping 45-minute historical drama that ran at Old North Church in the summers of 2023 and 2024. The play garnered critical acclaim and press coverage from the Associated Press, WBUR’s Radio Boston, and WGBH’s Boston Public Radio. Revolution’s Edge takes us to the afternoon of April 18, 1775, hours before the signal lanterns would shine from Old North’s steeple. With war on the horizon, Old North’s Loyalist rector, the Rev. Dr. Mather Byles Jr., is pushed to “resign” his post. As Byles and Cato (an African man enslaved by Byles) prepare to leave the church for the final time, they encounter Capt. John Pulling Jr., a prominent member of the congregation, ardent Patriot, and friend of Paul Revere. As these three real-life characters have an imagined conversation, long-simmering tensions reflecting the complexities of life in colonial Boston come to a boil. Revolution’s Edge invites audiences to consider the spectrum of political beliefs that existed during the Revolutionary War era and the ways that race, class, and personal experiences influence our beliefs and values today. The event will be held outdoors on Paul Revere Mall, a public and accessible space. In the event of rain, the reading will move across Hanover Street to St. Stephen’s Church. Guests will be greeted with live music before brief speaking remarks welcome the crowd and introduce the 45-minute costumed read of Revolution’s Edge. ASL interpreters will translate during the performance. Most audience members will stand, but space will be held for wheelchair and companion seating. Old North’s lanterns will light up soon after the play’s conclusion, at the beginning of the reenactment of Revere’s row across the Charles River. No tickets are required, but be sure to add the event to your calendar!

Meet performers Azaria Rose and Dirk (a professional puppeteer, educator — and dad!) who bring a collection of playful bedtime stories to the Puppet Showplace stage! In one story, a cat and dog host a talk show, interviewing every item needed to get ready for bed — including a gentle moon, some sassy stars, a toothbrush, and even a roll of toilet paper! In another tale, a young boy's attempts to fall asleep are interrupted by fantastical creatures from his dreams, who charge him with a daring mission! If he journeys to 'a land within,' can he help save the forests and end a war? Kids (and adults!) who love adventure stories and dreams will appreciate this story. These stories celebrate the power of imagination — 'very much inspired by my joy of playing/performing with my daughter,' says Dirk — and how our inner worlds fit into the larger world around us.

All ages welcome, especially enjoyed by ages 5 – 10 Mixed puppetry styles, including hand puppets, marionettes, and shadow puppets Length: 40 minutes Language: English From Baltimore, Maryland! “DEGRAG” was developed with support from a Jim Henson Foundation grant. About the Artist String Theory Puppet Theater is a small puppet troupe composed of Dirk Joseph and his daughters Sequoia and Azaria Rose. They have been performing since 2016, starting at the Black Cherry Puppet Theater’s puppet slams in Baltimore, sharing the stage with veteran and new puppeteers, Since then they have continued to be a regular at Black Cherry’s puppet slams. String Theory has also performed at Baltimore’s Creative Alliance and in multiple venues in D.C., as well as public schools and house shows. String Theory Puppet Theater performs a variety of puppetry styles for children and adults, including hand puppets, rod puppets, crankies, shadow puppets, marionettes, and toy theater. Their shows employ various narrative structures, ranging from one act pieces to multi-act stories to talk show formats, and they also produce “sing-along” performances and scrolling abstract progression. One of their performances titled “For the Love of Cats and Dogs” was nominated in 2018 for the National Puppet Slam held in Atlanta. “For the Love of Cats and Dogs” is a hilarious satire punctuated with dark metaphors about the dethroning of the tyrannical leader of the free world. Dirk Joseph, founder of String Theory Puppet Theater is a professional artist, storyteller, and community arts facilitator. He has been teaching visual arts and theater, including puppetry, in the New York and Maryland public school systems for almost 30 years.

Old South Lectures for Young People were also established in the summer of 1883 'as a means of promoting a more serious and intelligent attention to historical studies, especially studies in American history among the young people in Boston.” Today, the Old South Meeting House continues to educate the young people of Boston and remember Mary Hemenway's mission through our Family Hours programming.

Pottery/ceramics needs to be fired in a kiln twice (once for bisque and the second for glaze) which takes multiple days. Once glaze fired, the pieces will be durable. Both firings are included in the workshop fee and you get to pick how you want your piece to be glazed (colored) in the end! For this workshop ALL AGES ABOVE 5 are welcome to attend. Our typical age range for classes and workshops is 18+ though anyone over the age of 10 years old is welcome to attend (any person under the age of 13 must be accompanied by an adult at all times). Note: Shahane will be the instructor! She has taught pottery since 2016, got her BFA in ceramic arts in 2015 with a double minor in art history and psychology, and owns Pudgy's Place with her husband Phillip :)",$65.87

Zayde Babysits Before Passover Passover starts tonight and Zayde is babysitting for Ruthie―his first time by himself! Mommy has left a list of things to do: Buy parsley at the grocery store for the seder plate, go to the playground so Ruthie can use up energy, then use up more energy at home because seders last a long time. And be sure Ruthie takes a nap. But who exactly is babysitting whom as an afternoon of shenanigans ensue? Paulie’s Passover Predicament Paulie the moos-ician wants his seder to be perfect…but…it’s not. Paulie makes a series of amusing gaffes, like carving a radish into the shape of a horse instead of serving horseradish and getting locked in the basement when he searches for the afikomen.

In fact, electricity powers many of the biological processes in living things, including us! Even more surprising is that bacteria can use electricity to “breathe rocks.” What does this mean exactly? Join Harvard scientist Federica Calabrese as she uncovers how some microbes evolved to live in oxygen-free environments and how we can harness “bio-electricity” to power on own electronic devices. 3:00–3:30 pm The Icy Origin of Life Have you ever wondered how life began? The answer might be hidden in space—on tiny cosmic snowflakes! In the freezing depths of space, dust and gas come together to form icy particles that hold the ingredients for making planets and maybe even life itself. Scientists can recreate these conditions in the lab to better understand how simple molecules can transform into the building blocks of life.

Beginning at Mass Ave and Grove Street in Arlington, this ‘running’ battle will stretch nearly one mile of Mass Ave, ending at Medford Street. Spectators will watch several significant battle engagements. Spectators are only allowed to watch on the northern side of Mass Ave. About the Battle of Menotomy: The Battle of Menotomy was the longest and bloodiest engagement of April 19th, 1775. On that fateful day, Menotomy (now Arlington) was a crossroads village of about 400 farmers, millers, tavern keepers, and their families. Here 79 companies of minutemen from 16 towns, 3800 militiamen in all, surrounded and engaged His Majesty’s troops on their retreat from Concord and Lexington. While adding to the grim statistics of the day (forty royal troops killed, and 25 colonials lost), the Battle of Menotomy was decisive proof (as John Adams would argue to the Continental Congress) that the Crown and its colonies were in a state of war.

A handful of facilities have been established on Mars: a greenhouse, a mobile geological survey base, and a centralized research habitat. The primary human habitat is not on Mars, but on one of its moons, Phobos. A Spacecraft regularly ferries astronauts and scientists between the base on Phobos and the surface of Mars. The Spacecraft also carries parts to build a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to continue the search for evidence of life and water. However, when crew members discover an imminent threat to their Spacecraft and the Martian surface facilities, they must act quickly to save their stations, their research, and their lives.

His works cross boundaries and genres, encompassing solo artist albums, ballets, concert hall performances, cinema and television scores, video art installations, and theater works. Over the last two decades, Richter has brought his emotive sensibility to a series of ambitious projects – among them, a reimagining of Vivaldi’s violin concertos, the landmark nine-hour album Sleep and his score for Wayne McGregor’s ballet Woolf Works – along with acclaimed solo records tackling human rights, migration and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After spending many years grappling with big ideas and thorny social and political questions, the making of his latest album, In A Landscape, has opened up another, greener world for Richter. Making music remains, above all, “a way to make a kind of alternate reality,” a constructed world “where everything is in its place.” Max Richter will be performing with the American Contemporary Music Ensemble (ACME): Clarice Jensen, cello & artistic director Ben Russell & Laura Lutzke, violins Kyle Miller, viola Claire Bryant, cello",see below

In works by Corigiliano, Mustonen, Yoshimatu, and Shostakovich, fragments of themes and ideas emerge over time, slowly and imperfectly revealing themselves as part of a larger whole. Each piece takes us on a journey through extreme emotions which are rarely resolved, challenging us to perceive beauty in the small details that make up our lives, even when the whole remains unclear.

Music with Heart (aka the Boston Minstrels) has been providing a unique blend of musical entertainment, audience interaction and participation - and a sense of encouragement, involvement and hope - to Greater Boston homeless shelter guests, nursing home residents, senior center visitors and memory care patients since 1991. These shelters and centers are located in several Boston neighborhoods and in neighboring communities. On Saturday, April 26 (7 PM-10 PM) this non-profit volunteer group, founded by longtime Brighton residents Tim and Jane McHale, shares its talents with the public at our Annual Fundraiser at the Needham VFW Post, 20 Junction St. in Needham (near the commuter rail station). The event includes performances of rock, pop, folk and R and B favorites by our singers and musicians - heavy on attendee participation - along with dancing, a buffet dinner and a cash bar. And this year, we are joined by the Belmont-based Blues Dogs, a quartet of rock and roll animals (with four singers!) who will deliver a powerhouse set of blues and rock favorites - and hidden gems. Their catalogue spans the decades: from Ray Charles, the Allman Brothers and Bonnie Raitt to Stevie Ray Vaughn, Sheryl Crow and Steely Dan - and more. In 2024, Music with Heart danced, sang, and shared conversation at over 40 events, connecting with hundreds of people to make their day a bit more joyful. This year’s program, well underway, calls for some 50 Songfests and other events with more being added. Tax deductible tickets for the Fundraiser are $55 online at www.MusicWithHeartBoston.org or $65 at the door. Donations in lieu of ticket purchases are also most welcome.

The 8-week class will begin on Monday April 28th, from 5:45 to 7:15, at The First Parish in Wayland. The classes will be held in a studio setting and focus on fundamental skills, such as observation, perspective, scale, and technique (e.g. sketching). Various subjects, including still-life, landscape, and portrait will be included in the exercises. Oil pastels will provide a versatile medium for painting with bright colors. On the other hand, success with watercolor considered a difficult medium, will be all but guaranteed. This is what a past student had to say –“ I took an 8-week watercolor class with Ray Rahul in the spring of 2023. We painted a different still life arrangement each week. My goals (as a beginner) for the class were simple. I wanted to learn basic watercolor techniques and practice what I was learning with the guidance of a teacher. I also wanted to learn how to really see the subjects and to try to develop my own style. My goals were met and expectations exceeded. Ray taught us many basic techniques and helped us learn how to see objects in terms of perspective, relative placement, shapes, shadows, values, etc. I learned so much in his class and very much enjoyed the process.” Sign up: www.artswayland.com",$400

From a time when she was unable to fully embrace her identity as an artist to the moment of breaking free and stepping into her power, this exhibition captures the essence of becoming. It is not the end of a journey, but a testament to the sacred process of reclaiming one’s purpose.

The weekend continues to grow throughout the city, drawing in scores of local businesses and becoming a festive destination.  In the US, only New York has more artists per capita than the City of Somerville. During SOS, artists will open in every kind of working space, showcasing every kind of visual media. Throughout the city a visitor can see glass-blowers, jewelers, sculptors, digitally-based and interactive media artists, painters, photographers, weavers, printmakers, furniture makers, fashion designers, and artists whose media are too new to even have a name. Historic, converted industrial spaces such as Vernon Street and Joy Street hold more than 100 artists each; mid-sized buildings such as Mad Oyster Studios, Washington Street Art Center, Central Street, and others count their numbers in the dozens and often mount small group shows inside their buildings; Somerville’s Artisan’s Asylum is one of the largest maker spaces in the country. Not to be forgotten or overlooked, many visitors thrill to see how the scores of independent artists who make their studios in their homes integrate domestic and artistic lives into one. Somerville Open Studios is the only opportunity to get an intimate glimpse into some of these more private artist lives in what becomes equal parts Open Studios and home show. For Somerville artists without space to open to the public, SOS offers a Community Space at Arts at the Armory. The Cafe at the Armory will also house a Kid’s Art show for Somerville’s smallest future artists. The weekend features • Free trolleys to transport visitors from one neighborhood to the next (Sat & Sun) • Mapbooks available at artist-made stands throughout the city • Information kiosks located in both Davis and Union Squares • Orange balloons mark artist sites • Free, no-hassle parking in several city lots: leave your car and ride the free Trolley; City resident parking restrictions will also be lifted for this event • Some sites and one trolley will be handicapped accessible.

Meet the Puppets Stay after the show to meet the artists and see the puppets up close — The Gottabees speak English and Spanish! All ages welcome, especially enjoyed by 3 - 13 Mixed puppetry styles: hand puppets, rod puppets, tabletop and object puppetry, and live music Length: 40 minutes Language: Wordless From Boston!

They regularly sell out venues, inhabit computer screens, and inspire homemade puppet shows throughout the US, Canada, and beyond. They aim to inspire community, connection, and autonomy by providing an outlet for families to giggle, gasp, sigh, and cheer in forty-five minutes or less. The Gottabees' stories reflect children's everyday aspirations, concerns, and emotional experiences. ​​We want children to know in their hearts that they, too, can make theater wherever they are and whomever they are. The Gottabees’ work has been performed in 19 states, 5 countries, for over 45,000 people and was awarded an UNIMA-USA Citation of Excellence. Their projects have been funded by the Jim Henson Foundation, Puppeteers of America, USArtists International, Boston Cultural Council, and the Boston Foundation. The show was generously supported by Puppet Showplace Theater’s Incubator program, is a recipient of a 2018 Jim Henson Foundation Family Grant, was developed in part at the Charlestown Working Theater, and was also developed in part at the National Puppetry Conference at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. This piece was created in part at The Yard, an artist residency and performance center dedicated to contemporary dance, theater, and related arts, as part of the 2017 Off-Shore Creation Residency.",$18

Letting go is not about losing, it’s about release. It’s the moment you exhale after holding your breath for too long. It’s the acceptance that change is natural, and that chaos can be art. Elsa Campbell’s series The Beautiful Unknown, is a response to anxiety and fear of the unknown. A color palette based on nature offsets the intense and powerful marks providing visceral relief. The second series Seen and Unseen, obliquely references landscape and language by alternating mark making and obliteration of marks to create layers that are revealed and obscured. Daniel Gaviani blends color and form in a way that is both deliberate and free. Faces shift, perspectives blur, and the paintings pick up their own personality. By letting go and accepting non-deliberate outcomes, each painting became a practice of spontaneity, and even more important, acceptance. The Art of Letting Go runs May 3 – 31 at the Atlantic Works Gallery, 80 Border Street, East Boston, MA, open 2:00-6:00 pm, Fridays and Saturdays. The opening reception is on May 3, from 3:00-6:00 pm, the Third Thursday reception is on May 15, from 6:00-9:00 pm and the closing reception is on May 31, from 3:00-6:00pm.

We’ve created Acera as an alternative for students who love to solve problems, make things, ask deep questions, and thrive with an opportunity to create. Acera students experience regular school as a place with a ceiling that is too low, where they are not able to learn at a rapid enough rate or with enough depth and engagement to honor their voracious appetite for ideas, knowledge, and expression. Creative thinkers, robust readers, and deep thinkers experience a sense of belonging at Acera, a place with a runway that aligns with each students’ interests and potential.
